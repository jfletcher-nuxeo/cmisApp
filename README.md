# cmisApp

## Notes

Two example [CMIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_Interoperability_Services) clients for the Nuxeo Case Management Showcase.  Provided as examples of how to build CMIS clients using [CmisJS](https://github.com/agea/CmisJS).

Note: these applications require the Nuxeo Case Management Showcase to function correctly. They are not intended to be functional examples, they are just provided for reference. It's possible to create a working example by defining the necessary document types in your Nuxeo server; you can see required fields in the javascript source for each app.

Caveat: I am not a Web developer by trade so don't be surprised if the code is...surprising :)
